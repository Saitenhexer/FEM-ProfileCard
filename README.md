### What I learned

I found this one pretty difficult.

The whole layout and the spaces between things gave me some problems.

For the Statistics I used Grid. It seemed pretty logical to me. So i learned a lot about that.

Also the two background images and the positioning of those was a bit tricky. I found a very good solution which used the background-position property. I liked that solution very much.
